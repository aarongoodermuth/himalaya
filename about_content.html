  <h4>What is Himalaya.biz?</h4>
  <p>Himalaya.biz is your one stop for E-commerce! Here we combine the 
straightdorwardness of online shopping with the excitement of online auctions.

marketing your business's inventory online to tens of users!</p> 
</div>
<div id="why">
  <h4>Why did you create this site?</h4>
  <p>This site was a final project for a database class (CMPSC 431W) at 
Penn State University. This project was designed to teach us about database
design, web programming, and database-website interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div id="name">
  <h4>How did you choose the name?</h4>
  <p>In the project pitch, the suggested name was Himalaya.com. As a joke,
we talked about designing our own project and calling it Himalaya.biz. It
was supposed to be the 'more legit' version, as was obviously indicated by 
the name. The name stuck, and we have been running with it ever since.</p>

<div id="who">
  <h4>Who are you guys?</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nick Doyle</strong> is our SQL genius. While all of us know and
write SQL well, we find it easier to hand Nick any nontrivial query to write. 
The man will have it done faster than you can write SELECT * FROM tablename.</li>
      <li><strong>Mike Fitz</strong> is our UI genius. He found and implemented our 
'Flat UI' interface. He is also our 'Search and Browse' genius. Anything related
to that portion of the site you could bet was created by him.</li>
      <li><strong>Brian Golden</strong> is our scripts genius. Need something automated? 
Ask Brian. Need a script to send an email? Ask Brian. Need a script to rebuild the 
database from scratch? Ask Brian. He is also our password and security expert. 
Database got hacked? Blame Brian. But, Brian assures that this will never happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Aaron Goodermuth</strong> is our PHP genius. Aaron is the one that 
started implementation in PHP and set up much of the framework of the site. Aaron is also
our system administrator.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>We might want to offer you a job. Where can we find more of your work?</h4>
  <p>
It is worth noting that at the time of development, we all have job offers that we are 
extremely happy with. There may, however, come a time in the future that we are searching for 
new employment. Also, we are always open to offers which cannot be refused. </p>

    <p>With all that in mind, if you feel you want to see more of our work or get in touch 
with one or all of us:</p>
